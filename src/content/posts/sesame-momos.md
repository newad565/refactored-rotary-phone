## Sesame Momos

These handmade Tibetan vegetable momos are served with a spicy tomato sesame chutney and make a delicious appetizer or snack!

We’re talking dumplings, stuffed with a delicious cabbage, carrot, and onion filling. Spiced with garlic, ginger, cilantro, and a very generous amount of black pepper.

Studded with crumbled tofu and wrapped up in the cutest little round package, steamed and then served with a mouth watering spicy sesame tomato chutney.

It’s unclear whether momos have reached foodie fame because of their cute name, because they are really fun to eat, or because they’re crazy good. If you’ve never had a momo, it’s easy to fix!
